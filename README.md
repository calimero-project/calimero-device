Calimero KNX Device [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/calimero-project/calimero-device.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/calimero-project/calimero-device)
===================

The Calimero KNX network stack to run a KNX device on Java SE. This library allows you to implement your own KNX device on any platform that supports a JRE. The minimum required runtime environment is [Java SE 11](https://jdk.java.net/11/) (_java.base_). 

A code example for using this library is shown in [introduction](https://github.com/calimero-project/introduction):

* [KNX 2-state push-button device](https://github.com/calimero-project/introduction/blob/master/src/main/java/PushButtonDevice.java) 
* [Quick how-to for interacting](https://github.com/calimero-project/introduction) with the KNX device
